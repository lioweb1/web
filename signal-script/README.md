# Signal Script: Binary & Forex Signals Website

A self-hosted PHP + MySQL website for publishing binary options, forex and crypto trading signals. It runs on Hostinger shared hosting, cPanel or any normal PHP host, with no Node.js and no build step.

## Features

| Area | What you get |
|---|---|
| **Auto signal engine** | Pulls real candles (Twelve Data for forex, Binance for crypto) and scores them with EMA 9/21/50, RSI 14, MACD 12/26/9 and ATR 14. Creates **CALL/PUT** binary signals with expiry, and **BUY/SELL** forex/crypto signals with SL, TP1 and TP2 from ATR. |
| **Automatic results** | Binary signals are marked WIN/LOSS at expiry. Forex/crypto signals close when TP or SL is hit. Win rates are published on the Results page. |
| **Free + premium** | Signals at or above the "premium confidence" are locked for free users (blurred card and an upsell). There's an optional delay for free users and premium-only blog posts. |
| **Premium payments** | Plans (weekly, monthly…), manual payments (USDT, bKash, Nagad, bank…). The user submits a transaction ID and you approve it in admin, which activates premium automatically. |
| **Referral program** | Every user gets a referral link. The referrer gets free premium days when a referred user pays. |
| **Affiliate marketing** | Broker cards with your affiliate links, click tracking through `/go/ID` (total, unique, per page), and "Trade on X" buttons on every signal. |
| **Email opt-in** | Popup (timed + exit-intent), footer, homepage and registration opt-ins. Consent text, IP and date are stored. CSV export (with unsubscribe links) and CSV import, and an unsubscribe page. |
| **Telegram** | Auto-posts signals to free/premium channels, sends a premium teaser to the free channel, and posts WIN/LOSS results. |
| **CMS** | Blog posts (visual + HTML editor), custom pages (themed or raw full-HTML landing pages), menu/footer links, media library with uploads. |
| **Custom code** | `<head>` code (Analytics, Pixel), body/footer scripts, custom CSS/JS, 3 ad slots, per-page CSS. |
| **Customise** | Logo, favicon, colours, all homepage texts, disclaimer, timezone, ticker symbols, social links, all from Admin → Settings. |
| **Live UI** | TradingView ticker + chart on every signal, countdown timers, auto-refresh, and new-signal toast + browser notification. |
| **Crypto auto-payment** | Optional NOWPayments integration (USDT, BTC, ETH + 100 coins). The payment is verified by a signed IPN (HMAC-SHA512) and premium activates instantly, with no manual approval. |
| **Coupons & promo bar** | Discount codes (% off, max uses, expiry) on checkout, plus an announcement bar with a live countdown that hides itself when the offer ends. |
| **Trading tools** | `/tools`: position/lot size, risk:reward, pip value, binary profit & break-even, martingale table, compounding calculator. |
| **Markets page** | `/markets`: market overview, forex heatmap, cross rates, economic calendar, technical-analysis gauges (TradingView widgets). |
| **Performance stats** | 30-day wins/losses chart with cumulative win-rate line, accuracy per asset, current and best win streak. |
| **Trade journal** | Members click "I took this trade" on a signal. The result updates automatically, and the dashboard shows their win rate, P/L and ROI. |
| **Social proof** | Admin-managed testimonials and FAQ (with FAQ schema for Google), "How it works" steps, trust row. |
| **Mobile app (PWA)** | Installable to the home screen, offline fallback, "Install app" button, sticky mobile sign-up bar. |
| **Admin extras** | 30-day charts (signups, revenue, subscribers, clicks), one-click SQL backup, maintenance mode, premium expiry reminder emails. |
| **AI chat (Gemini)** | Floating "Ask AI" assistant on every page, powered by a free Google Gemini API key. It answers in the visitor's language (Bangla, Banglish, English…), knows your live signals, results, plans and brokers, and hides premium signals from free users. Daily limits per guest/free/premium, knowledge-base box, chat log and a "Test Gemini" button in admin. |
| **Security** | `password_hash`, PDO prepared statements, CSRF on every form, login rate-limit, honeypots, safe image uploads (no PHP execution in /uploads), and blocked internal folders. |

## Requirements

- PHP **8.1+** with `pdo_mysql`, `curl` and `mbstring`. Hostinger has all of these.
- MySQL 5.7+ / MariaDB 10.3+
- Apache or LiteSpeed with `.htaccess` (Hostinger uses LiteSpeed)

## Install on Hostinger (about 10 minutes)

1. **Domain + hosting**: in hPanel → Websites, add your domain.
2. **PHP version**: hPanel → Advanced → PHP Configuration → choose **PHP 8.2** (or 8.1/8.3).
3. **Database**: hPanel → Databases → MySQL Databases → create a database + user and note the name, user and password.
4. **Upload files**: hPanel → File Manager → `public_html` → upload a ZIP of the *contents* of this `signal-script` folder → Extract. `index.php` must sit directly in `public_html`.
5. **Run the installer**: open `https://yourdomain.com/install.php`, fill in the database and admin details, then click *Install now*.
6. **Delete `install.php`** in File Manager.
7. **Cron job** (this makes signals automatic): hPanel → Advanced → Cron Jobs → *Custom* → every minute (`* * * * *`):
   ```
   /usr/bin/php /home/u123456789/domains/yourdomain.com/public_html/cron.php
   ```
   Admin → Dashboard shows the exact path for your account. You can also use the cron URL with an external service such as cron-job.org.
8. **SSL**: hPanel → Security → SSL → install the free SSL certificate.

Then log in at `https://yourdomain.com/login`. Admin users go straight to `/admin/`.

### After installing

1. **Settings → Signal engine**: add a **free Twelve Data API key** (https://twelvedata.com) for forex pairs. Crypto pairs (BTCUSDT…) work without a key.
2. **Affiliate brokers**: replace "Example Broker" with your real affiliate links.
3. **Premium plans** and **Settings → Payments**: set prices, wallet addresses and bKash/Nagad numbers.
4. **Settings → Telegram** (optional): create a bot with @BotFather, add it as an admin of your channels, paste the token and channel IDs, then click *Test Telegram* on the dashboard.
5. **Settings → General / Homepage**: logo, colours, texts, timezone.
6. **Settings → Custom code**: Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, live chat, ads.

### Automatic crypto payments (optional)

1. Create an account at https://nowpayments.io and add your payout wallet.
2. Settings → API keys: create an API key. Settings → Payments: set an **IPN secret**.
3. Paste both into Admin → Settings → Payments & referral.

A "Pay with crypto" button then appears on checkout. Premium activates by itself when the payment is confirmed. Manual payments (bKash, Nagad, bank) still work alongside it.

### AI chat assistant (free Gemini API)

1. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/apikey → **Create API key** (free, Google account needed).
2. Admin → Settings → **AI chat (Gemini)**: paste the key, tick **Enable AI chat assistant** and save.
3. Admin → **AI chat** → *Test Gemini connection*.
4. Optional: write your support info, refund policy, Telegram link and offers in **Knowledge base**, then set daily message limits.

Notes:
- The API key stays on your server. Visitors talk to `/api/chat`, never to Google directly.
- Free Gemini keys have rate limits (requests per minute and per day). The daily limits per visitor keep you inside them. If the site gets busy, enable billing in Google AI Studio.
- On Google's free tier, prompts may be used by Google to improve their products, and chat questions plus visitor IPs are stored in your chat log. Mention the AI chat in your Privacy Policy page.
- The assistant is told never to promise profits and to give educational information only. Still, read the chat log now and then.

### Updating from an older version

Upload the new files over the old ones, but keep `config.php` and `uploads/`. The database is upgraded automatically on the next page load.

## Signal engine & API budget

The engine fetches data **only when a new candle closes** for each timeframe, so a cron that runs every minute stays inside free API limits.

| Data source | Used for | Key | Free limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Binance public market data | Symbols without a slash: `BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT`, `SOLUSDT`… | No | Very high |
| Twelve Data | Symbols with a slash: `EUR/USD`, `GBP/JPY`, `XAU/USD`… | Free key | 800 calls/day, 8/min |

Each forex pair costs one call per candle. Approximate calls per day:

| Timeframe | 1min | 5min | 15min | 1h |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Calls/day per pair | 1440 | 288 | 96 | 24 |

The default setup (EUR/USD binary on 5min, plus EUR/USD and XAU/USD forex on 15min) uses about 500 calls/day. The engine stops itself at the *daily call budget* (Settings, default 790). If you want more forex pairs or 1-minute binary signals on forex, upgrade your Twelve Data plan, or use crypto pairs, which are unlimited.

**How a signal is chosen:** each indicator votes BUY or SELL (EMA trend, fresh EMA crossover, EMA 50 trend, RSI momentum/reversal, MACD histogram, candle body). A signal is published only when a *fresh trigger* fires (an EMA crossover or a MACD histogram flip in the same direction) **and** the confidence is above your minimum. One open signal per asset at a time. You can also post **manual signals** from Admin → Signals.

> ⚠️ Technical indicators do **not** guarantee profits, and no engine wins every trade. The script shows real wins *and* losses. Keep the risk disclaimer visible. Binary options are banned for retail traders in some countries (EU, UK, USA and others), so check the law where you and your visitors are.

## File structure

```
index.php          front controller (all public pages)
admin/             admin panel (index.php + entities.php + views/)
cron.php           signal engine runner (cron job)
install.php        one-time installer, DELETE after install
inc/               bootstrap, helpers, engine, schema.sql (web access blocked)
views/             theme templates (edit to change the design)
assets/            css + js
uploads/           media uploads (script execution blocked)
storage/           lock files (web access blocked)
```

## Customising the design

- Colours, logo, texts and CSS overrides: **Admin → Settings**, no code needed.
- Bigger changes: edit `views/*.php` (plain PHP + HTML) and `assets/css/style.css`.
- A full custom landing page: Admin → Pages → new page → tick **Raw page** and paste any HTML.

## Moving to another host

Copy all files and `config.php`, export/import the database with phpMyAdmin, and change `base_url` in `config.php` if the domain changed.

## বাংলা সংক্ষিপ্ত গাইড

1. Hostinger hPanel থেকে PHP 8.2 সিলেক্ট করুন এবং একটি MySQL ডাটাবেস তৈরি করুন।
2. `signal-script` ফোল্ডারের সব ফাইল `public_html`-এ আপলোড করুন।
3. `https://আপনার-ডোমেইন/install.php` খুলে ডাটাবেস ও অ্যাডমিন তথ্য দিন, তারপর **install.php ডিলিট করুন**।
4. Cron Jobs-এ প্রতি মিনিটে `cron.php` চালানোর জন্য একটি cron যোগ করুন। এতে অটো সিগন্যাল তৈরি হবে এবং WIN/LOSS অটো চেক হবে।
5. Admin → Settings → Signal engine-এ ফ্রি Twelve Data API key দিন (ফরেক্স পেয়ারের জন্য)। ক্রিপ্টো পেয়ার key ছাড়াই চলে।
6. Affiliate brokers-এ আপনার অ্যাফিলিয়েট লিংক, Premium plans-এ দাম এবং Payments-এ bKash/Nagad/USDT নম্বর দিন।
7. Email list থেকে সব সাবস্ক্রাইবারের ইমেইল CSV হিসেবে ডাউনলোড করে Mailchimp/Brevo দিয়ে নিউজলেটার পাঠাতে পারবেন।
